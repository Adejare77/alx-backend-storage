# NoSQL

NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema for unstructured data and store data in different ways ranging from Column-Based (Apache Cassandra), Document-Based (MongoDB), Graph-Based (NeO4) or as a Key-Value store (Redis). Unlike SQL, NoSQL databases are horizontally Scalable. The have flexibility to store data without a predefined structure and versatility to add fields to the data structure on the go. They are very suitable for distributed systems
